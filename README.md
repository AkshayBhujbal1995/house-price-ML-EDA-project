## Project Overview  

The project examines the relationships between various housing features and their influence on house prices. Using data visualization, correlation analysis, and machine learning models, it provides insights and predictions.  

---

## Dataset Description  

The dataset contains housing data from King County, USA, including:  
- Features: `sqft_living`, `grade`, `bathrooms`, etc.  
- Target: `price`  

---

## Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` for numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning  
  - `datetime` for date handling  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis  

- **Key Findings**:  
  - `sqft_living` and `grade` have the highest positive correlation with house prices.  
  - Some features like `zipcode` and `long` have negligible correlation.  

- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Handling missing data  
  - Data type conversion (`date` to `datetime`)  
  - Correlation analysis  



## Modeling  

- **Models Used**:  
  - Simple Linear Regression  
  - Multiple Linear Regression  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - Polynomial Regression  

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - R² Score  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

- **Best R² Score**:  
  - **0.711** for Multiple Linear Regression (Test Data)  
  - **0.700** for Ridge Regression with Polynomial Features  



## How to Use the Code  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-pricing-analysis.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb  
   ```  


## Results  

The project demonstrates:  
- Significant predictors of house prices.  
- Accurate predictions using machine learning models.  



## Conclusion  

The analysis highlights the key drivers of house prices in King County. Models like Multiple Linear Regression and Ridge Regression are effective in predicting prices.  



## Future Work  

- Include more advanced models like XGBoost and Random Forest.  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.  
- Analyze data from additional regions.
